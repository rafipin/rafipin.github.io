                              <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
								<p>The idea for my IT project is development for a smartphone app that makes finding things to watch and where to watch them a lot easier. It is really great that we have an abundance of items to watch these days and places to watch them, however it has created a huge issue where we are overflown with options making a lot of us struggle to watch anything and just ending up shutting down the entire process. This app will combine all available streaming services into one package and use an algorithm to see your viewing activity as well as taking an interest survey when signing up to determine what is actually recommended for you. It won’t be limited to services such as Netflix but will stretch across all streaming platforms including free to air, providing accurate recommendations and places to watch them.</p>
                              <h2><b>Motivation</b></h2>
								<p>We seem to be spoilt with choice these days when it comes to entertainment streaming, I find myself end up watching nothing at all after being bombarded with a huge array of things to watch where it becomes overwhelming and I just go on to watch pointless YouTube videos instead. Moreover, sometimes one specific streaming service is not enough, to get exclusives and originals you have to browse so many other websites to find something you may actually like to watch. Therefore, I feel like users would really enjoy having an easy app to locate quality content suited to them and specific location of it.</p>
								<h2><b>Description</b></h2>
								<p>The app will be account based and will be accessible from all platforms whether it be browser based, App Store, or Google Play. It would benefit the user most if they linked their social media accounts so the algorithm can discover their likes and interests and recommend them content based on activity. The user would also answer questions on specific titles if they’ve seen them or not and if they enjoyed them, so the algorithm can determine what similar titles they would enjoy. This method would work better than just asking them to answer questions on what their favourite genre is as users normally do not answer that question correctly as they have multiple favourites, by developing a rating scheme for specific titles it would be more direct to similar actors, themes and genres. It will recommend titles across the board and tell them the cheapest way to watch them, be it via streaming service or only available as a rental or purchase. The app will also be able to offer promotions given by the specific company for joining their service making the user more inclined to sign up to a service (EG: Netflix) if they haven’t already. The UX will be really clean and easy to navigate as the main focus of the app is to reduce clutter when it comes to streaming video. It will also show popular content amongst the user’s demographic, whether it’s through location, age or viewing interests. The whole point of the app is not to have an information overload so users will be able to click if they’ve already seen a title so it would not appear again, this would also help the algorithm to determine similar titles to recommend. The service will be completely free as the money would come through advertising other services to watch content on and will create revenue from these specific services. There will be a lot of security for personal information and will not sell to advertisers so the user can be at ease about entering their information. It would have seamless integration with other applications where clicking a title would take you straight to the website or app to watch it so no need to search again in the linked app.</p>
                              
                              <h2><b>Tools & Technologies</b></h2>
                              JavaScript coding would be needed to create this mobile app as well as HTML5 web development to create the browser interface. There would need to be an agreement with the other streaming services as to how much information we can access of their customers in order to better provide recommendations based on viewing activity. It would also need a very secure database server which cannot be infiltrated by hackers or people inside the business as to ensure customer privacy.
                                 <h2><b>Skills Required</b></h2>
                              
                              The skills required for this project would be a sophisticated knowledge of programming and web development it would have to have slight artificial intelligence to provide accurate and relevant recommendations for the user as well a secure database server. It would take time and money to find crew to work on the project, another company will host the data server such as Google, or Amazon so it would be lower costs, however software and everything would be on the projects side only the hosting would be external to ensure more privacy. It would take a lot of negotiations with other companies to make the project come to tuition.
                              
                              <h2><b>Outcome</b></h2>
                              
                              If the project is successful, the outcome will be great for people seeking entertainment across the board. The original problem of content overload would be solved by showing best recommendations and not everything available, hopefully the impact of the app would allow users to have an easier experience to watch new content and not be completely lost with all the content that is advertised on their favourite streaming site. It would also help new streaming companies be able to advertise their service to users and it shows cheapest method of watching and allows for special offers to sign up.
