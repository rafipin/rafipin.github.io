								<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>I really love computers and all things that have to do with computers or Information Technology. My earliest memory of my abilities with IT was probably when I was 3 years old and I was at my grandfather’s house. I asked him if I could watch a specific VHS tape, he said that he did not know how to use it and wouldn’t able to help me. So, I responded, “It’s okay I will figure it out” and was able to plug in and start watching my VHS tape he was shell-shocked to say the least.</p>

								<h2>Why I chose RMIT?</h2>
								<p>I chose to come to RMIT as I personally did not really enjoy the learning structure of school, Monash would’ve been my first preference at the beginning of Year 12 as it is close to home and is where most of my friends are. However I came to realise that the learning style of Monash would be far too similar to school and I really want to go somewhere that I enjoy, I had heard RMIT would be much more of a relaxed, hands on learning environment and so far it has met all my expectations. During my studies I would hope to be very proficient in programming and be able to develop my own software and understand all the elements of IT such as networking and servers.</p>
