											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi my name is Rafi Pincus, I am currently studying Information Technology at RMIT University enrolled with a student number of s3722015.<br> I was born in South Africa and moved to Australia in 2009 when I was 10 years old.<br> I came from a Jewish background culturally and I know basic elements of the language ‘Hebrew’.<br> I graduated VCE in 2017 and took a gap year before deciding to study at RMIT.<br> I really enjoy playing video games, most notably Overwatch right now.<br> I also like to watch all sports with an oval ball or round ball, be it soccer, footy or NRL. My favourite of the 3 sports shifts depending on which of my teams  are doing the best at that point in time between ‘Melbourne Storm, ‘Collingwood’ or ‘Manchester United’.</p>
                                      <h2>Interest In IT</h2>
                                      <p>I really love computers and all things that have to do with computers or Information Technology. My earliest memory of my abilities with IT was probably when I was 3 years old and I was at my grandfather’s house. I asked him if I could watch a specific VHS tape, he said that he did not know how to use it and wouldn’t able to help me. So, I responded, “It’s okay I will figure it out” and was able to plug in and start watching my VHS tape he was shell-shocked to say the least. <br>
Later on, in life I was always the go to person for my friends with setting up their computer or helping them preform basic actions in the school computer lab. I always have had an unexplainable sense of excitement whenever I am able to fix an IT problem. I don’t have any professional IT experience however I find that I am able to perform problem solving solutions when it comes to IT with ease. My excitement for IT probably started when I took apart a computer in Year 9 Cyberspace class and got to see the RAM, CPU, GPU etc. in all its glory, was a pretty cool moment. <br> 
I chose to come to RMIT as I personally did not really enjoy the learning structure of school, Monash would’ve been my first preference at the beginning of Year 12 as it is close to home and is where most of my friends are. However I came to realise that the learning style of Monash would be far too similar to school and I really want to go somewhere that I enjoy, I had heard RMIT would be much more of a relaxed, hands on learning environment and so far it has met all my expectations. During my studies I would hope to be very proficient in programming and be able to develop my own software and understand all the elements of IT such as networking and servers.

                                 <h2> Analysis of Results</h2>
								<p>The results seem to indicate a common trend of extraversion being my strongest trait. Extraversion refers to a person who seeks to find stimulation from the outside world, especially in the forms of attention from others. Extraverts also seem to really savour accomplishments in tasks more than introverts. Being an extrovert in the IT field seems to be a unique trait which will really help me in achieving goals and engaging with clients.<br> Being a visual learner is also great this enables me to enhance my coding skills and IT skills, because a hands-on approach is the best way to learn in IT, so me being able to learn by doing and seeing can assist me in gaining new ideas. <br>
My openness in the big five personality test and my prospecting trait in the Morrisby-Briggs test will help me work within a team environment as I will be able to hear different ideas and can implement actions for decision making and planning. However my agreeableness trait I will need to work on, as it would seem that I am not completely open to agree with other perspectives than mine thus impacting my ability to work in a team. Being in a team is all about working together and agreeing on the best method, even if they are not your own.<br>
When forming a team I should take these negative traits into account, as to find solutions to combat them. <br> On the positive side I should embrace my extraversion by taking initiative in the team environment and building on ideas and motivating others.
